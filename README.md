# FaceQuest

FaceQuest is a Python-based application that helps users find images of the same person from a large dataset of images stored in a folder named `dataset`. The project is designed to work through a Telegram bot, allowing users to interact with the system, upload images, and manage their searches conveniently.

## Features

- **Image Search:** Users can search for images of a person from the `dataset` folder.
- **Image Verification:** The bot verifies whether the image the user is searching for is their own by asking them to send a selfie with two fingers up.
- **Database Storage:** All found images are stored in a database for easy retrieval during future searches.
- **Multiple Users:** The system can handle multiple users at the same time, ensuring a smooth experience for everyone.
- **Automatic Recognition:** If a user searches for the same person again, the bot will automatically ask if it's the same person from a previous search. If confirmed, it will retrieve the images from the database.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload multiple images to the `dataset` folder, including images in document form, via the Telegram bot.
